## Problem
* It is difficult for normal people to classify the background of scientific statements and what is serious. 
* Climate change is a very complex subject with a  lot of misinformation circulating. 
* This misinformation creates uncertainty. 
* Some incorrect information is scattered by climate skeptics, with the aim to sow doubt and ultimately to prevent climate protection.
